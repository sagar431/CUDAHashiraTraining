# Day 2: Setting Up the Development Environment 🛠️

## **Core Topic** 📚
Setting up a robust CUDA development environment - like preparing your Nichirin blade for demon slaying! Today we'll ensure all our tools are ready for the journey ahead.

## **Setup Checklist** ⚔️
- [ ] Install NVIDIA GPU Drivers
- [ ] Install CUDA Toolkit
- [ ] Configure Environment Variables
- [ ] Test Development Environment
- [ ] Set up Code Editor/IDE

## **Environment Requirements** 🎯
1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capability
   - Sufficient RAM (8GB minimum recommended)
   - Adequate storage space for CUDA Toolkit

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Operating System: Windows/Linux/macOS
   - NVIDIA GPU Drivers
   - CUDA Toolkit (Latest stable version)
   - A code editor (VSCode recommended)
   - Git for version control

## **Installation Guide** 📖
1. **GPU Drivers**:
   - Visit NVIDIA's website
   - Download appropriate driver for your GPU
   - Follow installation instructions

2. **CUDA Toolkit**:
   - Download from NVIDIA Developer portal
   - Choose the version compatible with your system
   - Follow installation wizard

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add CUDA paths to system PATH
   - Set up CUDA_HOME
   - Configure library paths

## **Verification Steps** 🔍
1. Check NVIDIA driver installation:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

2. Verify CUDA installation:
   ```bash
   nvcc --version
   ```

3. Test environment variables:
   ```bash
   echo %CUDA_HOME%    # Windows
   echo $CUDA_HOME     # Linux/macOS
   ```

## **Common Setup Issues** ⚠️
- Driver/CUDA version mismatch
- Missing environment variables
- Incorrect PATH settings
- Installation order problems

## **Best Practices** 💡
- Always check compatibility matrices
- Keep drivers updated
- Document your setup process
- Maintain clean environment variables
