# Common CUDA Beginner Pitfalls 🎯

## Compilation Issues ⚠️
1. **Missing Headers**
   - Not including necessary CUDA headers
   - Forgetting to include standard C/C++ headers

2. **Compiler Flags**
   - Wrong architecture flag (-arch=sm_XX)
   - Missing required flags
   - Incorrect file extension (.cu vs .cpp)

## Runtime Issues 🔥
1. **Memory Management**
   - Not checking cudaMalloc return values
   - Forgetting to free GPU memory
   - Using CPU pointers on GPU and vice versa

2. **Synchronization**
   - Missing cudaDeviceSynchronize()
   - Not handling asynchronous operations properly
   - Race conditions between CPU and GPU

## Debugging Tips 🔍
1. **Error Checking**
   ```cpp
   // Always check CUDA API calls
   cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&d_array, size);
   if (err != cudaSuccess) {
       fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
       // Handle error...
   }
   ```

2. **Common Error Messages**
   - "invalid device function" → Wrong architecture flag
   - "launch failed" → Kernel execution error
   - "unspecified launch failure" → Memory access issues

## Best Practices 💡
1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep kernel launches and memory operations organized
   - Document your grid and block dimensions
   - Use meaningful variable names (e.g., d_array for device arrays)

2. **Development Flow**
   - Start simple, then optimize
   - Test with small data first
   - Use proper error checking from the beginning

Remember: Like a Demon Slayer's training, mastering CUDA takes practice and attention to detail. Learn from these common mistakes to become stronger! 💪
