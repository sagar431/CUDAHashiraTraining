# CUDA 120-Day Challenge: Demon Slayer Edition üî•
![Zenitsu Thunder Breathing](zenitsu-swordsmanship_800.gif)

Welcome to my CUDA 120-Day Challenge repository, themed around *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba*! This repository documents my journey to master NVIDIA CUDA programming over 120 days, with daily exercises, notes, and capstone projects. Inspired by the determination of Tanjiro Kamado and the fiery spirit of Zuntsu (a nod to the Demon Slayer universe), I'm tackling GPU parallel programming, memory management, and performance optimization.

## **About the Challenge** ‚öîÔ∏è
This 120-day curriculum covers:
- **Daily Topics**: Core CUDA concepts, practical exercises, and debugging pitfalls.
- **Capstone Projects**: Six major projects at Days 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 to synthesize skills.
- **Resources**: References to CUDA guides, best practices, and profiling tools.

Each day includes:
- A core topic to study
- A practical exercise or mini-project
- Common debugging pitfalls to avoid
- Suggested resources for deeper learning

## **Demon Slayer Theme** üó°Ô∏è
Just as Tanjiro trains to become a Demon Slayer, I'm training to master CUDA programming. The fiery spirit of Zuntsu (a reference to the intense battles in *Demon Slayer*) inspires me to tackle challenges like:
- Warp divergence (like a Demon Slayer squad facing a split path)
- Memory coalescing (synchronized breathing techniques of Demon Slayers)
- Kernel optimization (sharpening your CUDA skills like a Demon Slayer's blade)

## **How to Use This Repository** üéØ
1. Start with the daily folders (`Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc.) to follow my progress
2. Check the `code` subfolder for CUDA source files (e.g., `.cu` files)
3. Review the `notes` subfolder for debugging pitfalls and lessons learned
4. Explore the capstone projects for comprehensive applications of CUDA concepts
